## What You’ll Learn

In this guide, we’ll cover:

- Creating your first SignalR Hub  
- Testing SignalR from Postman  
- Creating strongly typed hubs  
- Sending messages to a specific user

Let’s explore how SignalR can help you build powerful real-time applications.

## Installing and Configuring SignalR

To start using SignalR, you’ll need to:

1. Install the required NuGet package.
2. Create a Hub class for managing clients and sending messages.
3. Register SignalR services and map the hub endpoint to enable client connections.

---

## Testing SignalR with Postman

SignalR hubs can be tested with Postman's WebSocket feature. To test, you can:

1. Connect to the SignalR hub.
2. Set the communication protocol to JSON.
3. Send and receive messages using specific message formats.

---

## Strongly Typed Hubs

SignalR supports strongly typed hubs, which make it easier to work with client-side methods and avoid errors. This approach enhances the reliability of your real-time application.

---

## Sending Server-Side Messages

SignalR allows sending messages from the backend to connected clients seamlessly. This can include notifications, alerts, or updates. You can even send messages to specific users by leveraging the user identifier provided by SignalR.

---

## Securing SignalR Hubs

To ensure security:

- Use authentication to restrict hub access to authorized users.
- Use SignalR’s built-in support for tracking user connections via user identifiers.

---

## Summary

Real-time functionality can transform your applications, offering innovative features and a better user experience. SignalR simplifies the implementation of real-time communication in .NET by handling message transport and user management internally.

### Key takeaways:

- SignalR hubs are central to real-time communication.
- Secure your hubs with authentication and user tracking.
- With SignalR, real-time capabilities can be implemented in minutes.
